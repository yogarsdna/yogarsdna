# Halo semua! 

Allow me to introduce myself, my name is Gede Yoga Arisudana.\

I am an Undergraduate Informatics Student at Institut Teknologi Sepuluh Nopember Surabaya.\

I am currently interested in learning things related to data such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, Data Mining, Data Analytics, Big Data, etc., and I also have a big interest in machine learning. Learning machine learning algorithms is an exciting yet challenging thing to do for me.\

If you are interested in getting to know me, please contact me via [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gede-yoga-arisudana-81a52a1bb/).
